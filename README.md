# Building-a-folder-organizer
For my first experience creating a GUI for an app, i'm trying to create a .exe from a python script that organize all my files in folder based on this extension.
I'm testing the function in tkinter to understand what i can do and tried to add more aesthetic desingn using bootstrap with ttkbootstrap.
This is just my first project using interface but i tried to write clearer comments to be more intuitive for other that want to use.
