# Building-a-folder-organizer
For my first experience in crafting a graphical user interface (GUI) for an application, I am currently in the process of generating a .exe executable file from a Python script. 
This script's primary purpose is to efficiently organize files within a directory based on their file extensions. As part of this learning journey, I am experimenting with the tkinter library to explore its capabilities, aiming to gain a comprehensive understanding of its features. In addition to functionality, I am also focusing on enhancing the aesthetic design of the GUI, utilizing Bootstrap through the ttkbootstrap library.

While this project represents my maiden venture into interface design, I am committed to making it as user-friendly as possible for those who may wish to utilize it. To achieve this, I've placed a strong emphasis on writing clearer and more intuitive comments within the codebase
